      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I have always had an intrest in astronomy. I took this furhter by studying astrophysics at univeristy. While I was there, I gained a passion for atmospheric dynamics. I enjoy gardening, specifically growing food. I first started growing carrots, radishes and lettuces when I was in north Wales. I have always enjoyed reading but latly I have read alot of Lovecraft stories and really enjoy how he conveys such abstract ideas and shapes to the reader.</p>
