# Portfolio
## Jon Donaldson Portfolio

**Introduction**
>This README is to show how all the code for my Portfolio website operates. The website is designed to show off my skills and experience for future employers.
This code has one page in .html for every web page.
The code is written in HTML with a single CSS style sheet and bootstrap link for formatting.

**Foundation**
>Each web page has a corresponding .html page. These pages are called profile[webpageTitle].html. Home is the first page that future employers will see and from there, About, Skills and Contact pages will be reachable.

**Difficulties**
>I found positioning still very difficult to impletment properly and I ended up with a lot of boxes out of place, however I think this look actually works better for the style of this Portfolio.
Using the '@media screen and () {}' wasn't too difficult most of the time however, I had a particular problem with images.
Most of my problems were solved by just reading carefully what/where I was typing and affecting.

**Successes**
>I am pleased with how i managed to fix the background. and also how the minimal window width aligns most of the boxes.
